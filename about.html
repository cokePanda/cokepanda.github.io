        Howdy, I am Jake Z, living in Shanghai, China. <br>
        <br>
Having been moving around, <br>
from village to city, <br>
from a small city to another big one, <br>
from China to US and then back to China, <br>
from major in science to engineering, <br>
from technical to humanity, <br>
from dream to be a physicist to anthropologist,<br>
from mahjong to Texas hold'em and PLO, <br>
I appreciate all my experience from life which is like a river, to swim in it like a fish instead of resisting it. Panda and coke are both popular on this planet, combined to make the name of a bridge I attempt to build to connect the west and orient, north and south. Maybe you could see some fresh and odd stuff through my eyes which inspires you to explore new world. <br>
<br>
Hope you have fun here. If any share it with your friends; if not at all send it to your ex. OK, I am just joking. 
<br>
