It is definitely not a right time to visit any railway station especially in big cities where you would understand the huge population of this country from your right shouder to the left one, even with the benefits of rapid infrastructure construction through more then ten years since this century.<a id="more"></a> So in days of staying in US, I put ‘crowded’ on the uselesswords list maybe occasionally ecept for some game day when you could sell your spare parking lot for a few bucks. I could not understand those shops in mall make any profits which few customers come to visit for a long time. Maybe those salespersons were just waiting for black Friday a whole year along </p>
