<font size="5">*K*</font>ong Rong recommended Mi Heng <font color="black">`祢衡`</font> to Cao Cao. However, Mi blamed Cao without fear. Cao got angry, and told Rong,"Such a spoiled guy Mi is! I would like to kill him like a bird or mouse, but he is much of fame long, so people here and there would say I can not accommodate mavericks ." Therefore Cao sent Mi to Liu Biao, who took respect of Mi, and also Mi complimented Liu indefinitely, but got used to sarcastically mock persons close to Liu. <!--more-->Those waited for chances and set up Mi before Liu,"Heng say my lord you is of goodness even beyond Lord West, but only short of deciding in time which leads to failure of your future." These words pierced the mind of Liu, which Mi actually did not say out though. Liu got bitterly and finally moved Mi to Huang Zu, the governor of Jiangxia, for his lousy temper. Initially Huang took good care of Mi, but eventually killed him for publicly insulting.

This story happened around A.D. 200 which I picked up a piece from *Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government* <font color="black">`资治通鉴`</font> I would like to call as *a long long long story over 1362 years* which healed my procrastination partly. One day by one day I finished reading of it on my [panda kindle3](http://www.cokepanda.com/03/12/2013/My-Panda-Kindle3-One-Of-A-Kind/) the first time for almost one year and the second time for another year. Still on the way reading it for the third time, but much slower because of lack of time. The book is written and edited by a group led by Sima Guang who was a minister during Song Dynasty. The aim is to help the then young emperor to learn how to rule the people and land under the sky from what his preceded counterparts did. However other than the activities and speeches of emperors, kings, ministers and celebrities, we still could see some stories of grass-root people's everyday life which add much more worth of reading. I had to admitted that in the book I saw a botany garden with all kinds of lives growing from seeds to gorgeous flowers or tall trees and eventually waning into soil in forms of nutriment for next generation. The director of history is nature of human and everything. Why not save money and time for some lousy movie, just pick up a history book, sip a tea and get immersed in those old time.
