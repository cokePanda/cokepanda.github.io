"It's a teacher who pulled back the girl finally." said a firefighter from fire brigade of Yinchan, mentioning that when they and 120 (medic emergency staff) reached the site, those boys had held up quilts for a while. Then they set up professionally a rescue cushion instead. The accident happened at a 13-story dorm only residing girls. At spotting the girl's dangerous behavior, boys quickly moved away the bicycles around the building, carried out their own quilts, and lifted them forming a huge saving net.
