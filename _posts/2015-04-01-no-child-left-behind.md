<font size="5">*F*</font>irst, let's do some math. 53+53+53+53=212 means 53x4=212. Here we go.

Once an educator conducted an experiment in which he gave a Chinese kid and an American kid a cup of water each and asked them to boil it without fire. The Chinese kid tried to heat water exposed to sun light until sunset and failed, while the smart American kid went to get another three cups, divided the water into four cups evenly at 53 ℉, and then put them together, bingo, the water boiling at 212℉. The educator concluded that the rigid brain mode and backward social system never could cultivate great scientists with innovative consciousness.    

 One day the educator got bored and conducted the same experiment again. This time the Chinese kid learned a little bit and went straight to mix four cups of water evenly at 53 ℉. Yes, he won it at first. The water was boiled. The artless American kid went outside and placed water on the ground in the sun and waited calmly until moon rose. It was such a good day and the water temperature reached 212℉ boiling point. The educator was excited about his new finding that the American kid still held glory even though he lost, because it showed that kids in American school were honest and never played tricks which paved the way to be a citizen with integrity.  

The fund applied by the educator came into hands. In order not to waste money, he gathered more kids to take part in the experiment. The new-coming Chinese kids routinely put water outside in the sun and failed undoubtedly. However the clever American kids gathered together, elected a leader and brainstormed with freedom so that a great idea came out. Mixing up four cups of water at 53 ℉ brought it boiling. Again, the rigid brain mode and backward social system neither could cultivate great scientists with innovative consciousness, nor train youth to be cooperative and friendly.

There were some left in the fund for the educator to test another kids to conquer the same mission. Chinese kids had a team-meeting and finally got the way of mixing up water. American kids one by one went out to place water in the sun. God bless American. After one daytime heating, they made it. It was obvious that Chinese kids never could learn to solve problem individually and always depend on others, while American kids were all heroic and able to survive by themselves what made such a great nation.

The educator published fabulous papers on this experiment which encouraged him to go further. American kids contemplated the problem thoroughly, confirmed it as impossible mission and gave it up wisely. Poor Chinese kids insisted on putting the water outside room for whole day even it's cloudy, refused to go home for dinner even after being dismissed,  and still failed. We saw that American kids could determine the possibility in advance, be content with what they already had and never dwell in dead ends. At other hand, under the mode of knowledge-feeding, Chinese kids were stuck in impossible task like fool and hardly capable to be great scientists.

The educator kind of had fun with the experiment and could not stop. Chinese kid gave it up directly. While American kid grabbed his father's rifle from home  and killed the educator to end the annoyance of being studied. What a good example that American kid was born to resist to any oppression. That was better than any other education. The educator wrote down these words during his last seconds.  

Rewritten from a popular fabricated story with anonymity spread on many websites in China to mock some Chinese who went too far.
