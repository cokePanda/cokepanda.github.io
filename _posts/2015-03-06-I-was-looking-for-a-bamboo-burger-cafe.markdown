<font size="5">*L*</font>ocal time 2:18 am on March 5, a panda was found wandering in the streets at scenic spot of Yingxiu town Wenchuan county, Sichuan on surveillance video clips of several crossings lasting three minutes. On the morning experts were notified and ran to the place. Through the video analyzing the figure, walking style, behavior of the panda and checking if the feces it left contained any parasite, they concluded that it is two years old, healthy and almost adult without sign of wounded. After that people were attempting to seek for this cute guy but failed and no more clues were collected, so maybe it had just finished visiting and gone back to its wild home.
