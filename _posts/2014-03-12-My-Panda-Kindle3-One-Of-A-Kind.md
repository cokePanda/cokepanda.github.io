<font size="5">*R*</font>ecently my white kindle3 could not resume from blank screen even though I tried any way to save it back. Fortunately I have another kindle3 of black color I am kind of a little bit picky about. When I put them together, bingo , a wonderful idea came out. Why not resemble a unique panda kindle3 combining them? 

It was not very difficult. I used a credit card to open the back. Just need to take much care of the Eink screen which is rather fragile. Actually I did break one of them. :(. But finally a one-of-a-kind panda kindle3 was created.
 
I had to admit that I thought the whole kindle thing was a stupid idea before having bought a kindle DXG model and read on it. Why would I want to carry another device with only function of reading other than cellphone and laptop. And it poorly displays only black and gray, not even white, which a panda could mock about. In no time, I found I was totally wrong about it after I started to read books on it. My eyes felt much more comfortable than on computer or cellphone screen. And it is portable and energy-saving.You make yourself concentrate on reading since it only works well for that. I couldn't help buying two kindle3s on black Friday at Target store. Until now kindle3 is on my what-you-should-have list.

So, keep trying new stuff.
