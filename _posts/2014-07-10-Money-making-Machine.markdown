<font size="5">*F*</font>irst of all I'm not talking about printer of banknotes here, but share some thought of mine. That is why I start cokepanda. In my view, writing is the same as working mode of cook or bartender. All you need is to test and test the unique recipes fitting customers' appetite with the lowest cost or even nothing. You have the tool, pen and paper ,laptop or cellphone, your eyes and brain. You have the unlimited and free materials, words. You could built a castle, farm, river, island, planet, or even a cosmos by manipulating words. You make it as long as someone is willing to come and visit. Could you imagine in China the top net novelist makes around 20 million rmb (more than $3 million) one year?

More generally, you need to handle people(or your brain), tools and materials to resemble a system to produce anything that meets your target customers' needs. Sounds like a factory, right, but may be broader or thinner in scope. A cook and a president both run a system just differing from the size and specialty. 

Why do we watch TV or read paper for news everyday? Release from the fear that we are outdated and disconnected to the world. Most of daily time we are controlled by our body which makes decisions by quick and foolish reflex. For example, we drink too much soda made of water and sugar after a long-time jogging to lose fat. Those companies spend most of running money in ad to tell our body, "good boy/girl, take it". What does a lottery do? It gives you a hope. Car insurance uses your money to deposit for possible future accident spending while leaving more of it to their accounts.   

Do you own any stocks? Do you really think others will make money for you instead of themselves? You just bought a hope as you entered a casino and got some chips.
