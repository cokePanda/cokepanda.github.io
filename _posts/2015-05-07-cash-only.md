<font size="5">*I*</font>f you travel in China, definitely you will see some boxes placed to collect money for best wishes especially in temples. It is optional and you could just put in a few bucks or even none at all.  We Chinese maybe do not believe in Christ, but do in god of money and luck, and are willing to sacrifice money to get their blessings. Sounds like investments, right? The biggest difference between them and the guys in wallstreet is that you need to pay much less and lose much less.
Recently, visitors to Beijing Nature Museum noticed that people are inserting money to a dinosaur display box on the first floor.

Five meters long, one meter wide and around two meters high, the money box contains a skeleton of Lotosaurus under which there are many banknotes and coins, with value of 50 cents to ten yuan (near $2). With a closer observation, besides the money, you can see a photo for id and a train ticket. And a foreign banknote is even clamped at the edge of the box.

It's said by the staff of the museum that those money are all dropped by visitors through
