<font size="5">*I*</font>f you travel in China, definitely you will see some boxes placed to collect money for best wishes especially in temples. It is optional and you could just put in a few bucks or even none at all.  We Chinese maybe do not believe in Christ, but do in god of money and luck, and are willing to sacrifice money to get their blessings. Sounds like investments, right? The biggest difference between them and the guys in wallstreet is that you need to pay much less and lose much less.
Recently, visitors to Beijing Nature Museum noticed that people are inserting money to a dinosaur display box on the first floor.

Five meters long, one meter wide and around two meters high, the money box contains a skeleton of Lotosaurus under which there are many banknotes and coins, with value of 50 cents to ten yuan (near $2). With a closer observation, besides the money, you can see a photo for id and a train ticket. And a foreign banknote is even clamped at the edge of the box.

It's said by the staff of the museum that those money are all dropped by visitors through gaps between top and surrounding of the display box. It started from a year ago and never ended, accumulating to several hundred of rmb (close to $100. "We do not understand why it happens. Maybe just for fun. Drop money could anyone. of whom are likely kids." A security guy said that they would not stop visitors since no harm to the belongs of the museum.

Donating to temple kind of makes sense, but what's it for to drop money to dinosaur bones? A Professor from Sociology Department of Peking University explained that maybe some visitor randomly inserted coins and
later-comers complied under conformity.  

If you are traveling right now in Beijing, go say hi to the dinosaur and drop a small currency of your own country for best wishes.
